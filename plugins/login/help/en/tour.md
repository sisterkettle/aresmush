# Touring the Game

To talk to other players or do much of anything, you'll need to log in with a character. If you're just checking out the game and aren't sure if you want to stay long-term, you can create a temporary character with the `tour` command (or web portal Tour button). This will automatically assign you a temporary name and password, which will be shown to you. For example:

> %% Your temporary character name is Guest-1 and password is ABC123.

`tour` - Create a guest character with a temporary name and password.

When you're done looking around, you can either:

- Log out and let the character be recycled at the next idle character purge. 
- Keep the character. You will need to change your character's name/password using the [`name`](/help/name) and [`password`](/help/password) commands or the web portal [Account](/account) screen.
