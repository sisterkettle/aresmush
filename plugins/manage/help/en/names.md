# Names and Aliases

All characters have a one-word name.  This can be their first name, last name or nickname depending on the game's naming policy.  A character can also have a single nickname/alias.  You can substitute the alias in any command that uses character's name.

`rename me=<new name>` - Changes your name.
`alias <name>` - Sets your alias.  Leave blank to clear it.
  
You can also edit your name and alias through the web portal [Account](/account) page.

> **Note:** After you're approved, you need to contact an admin to change your name.
